# vocatus
The free-flowin', home-growin', god of liquor, Vocatus is intended to create a drink monitoring system allowing for the accurate tracking of liquid through a tubing system.

The initial use case is intended to service a beer bong that will track the rate at which users drink the beer, the time it takes to drink such beer, and the number of beers finished in a given time period.

Long term, this software should be robust enough to handle credit card transactions, database storage, possibly integration with national or state identification systems to track age of consumers and data rich displays. It is intended to be used in bars.
