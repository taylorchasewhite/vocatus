# Vocatus
The free-flowin', home-growin', god of liquor, Vocatus is intended to create a drink monitoring system allowing for the accurate tracking of liquid through a tubing system.

The initial use case is intended to service a beer bong that will track the rate at which users drink the beer, the time it takes to drink such beer, and the number of beers finished in a given time period.

Long term, this software should be robust enough to handle credit card transactions, database storage, possibly integration with national or state identification systems to track age of consumers and data rich displays. It is intended to be used in bars.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

These are a few of our favorite things (and requirements to contribute to and consume our technology):

* You'll need an [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/), we recommend getting the [starter kit](https://store.arduino.cc/usa/arduino-starter-kit).
* An [IDE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integrated_development_environment). We use [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* An Arduino account and access to the [web editor](https://create.arduino.cc/editor)
* A (cheap) [flow meter](https://www.amazon.com/Flowmeters/b?ie=UTF8&node=3206433011)
* (optional) [Processing](https://processing.org/download/) - Used to display a control board on your machine from the microcontroller.
* And last but not least, Github (obviously)



### Installing

A step by step series of examples that tell you how to get a development env running

1. Power up your Arduino by plugging into your computer.
1. Import the Arduino/VocatusController/ files into the web editor. Make sure it compiles using the verify button.
2. Upload to your Arduino.
3. Open Processing
4. Open the Arduino/VocatusStatusBoard/VocatusStatusBoard.pde file
5. Run
6. Set up a funnel connected to your wired up flow meter.
7. Pour away!
